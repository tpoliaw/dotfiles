# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%m/%d/%Y"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"

  # And much more! For more information, visit the docs: https://espanso.org/docs/

  # This only works in non-terminal apps for some reason
  - trigger: ":shrug"
    replace: "¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"

  - trigger: :amy
    replace: amygdala
    propagate_case: true

  - trigger: ":loc"
    replace: "http://localhost"

  - trigger: ".dau"
    replace: ".diamond.ac.uk"

  - trigger: "h:/"
    replace: "http://"

  - trigger: "hs:/"
    replace: "https://"

  - trigger: "--ndf"
    replace: "--no-default-features"

  # Common Typos
